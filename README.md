# Banker's Algorithm

The Banker's Algorithm is a resource allocation and deadlock avoidance algorithm used in operating systems. It is used to ensure that processes can request and use resources without causing deadlock. This repository provides an implementation of the Banker's Algorithm in Python.


## Getting Started

To use the Banker's Algorithm implementation, you can simply clone this repository and run the `OS assignment.py` file

```
python OS assignment.py
```
